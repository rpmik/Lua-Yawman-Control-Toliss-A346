# Installation
Note that the current script does not modify your axes. You'll need to set up your Yawman Arrow's axes as you like.

Assignments closely matches Yawman's PMDG 777 mappings but there are notable differences. See Yawman's [discord](https://discord.gg/dcpTc5KP).

# TODO
* Implement radio tuning

# Assignments are In Work!
Sixpack 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are referred to as SP1, SP2, SP3 etc. These are the two rows of three buttons, where the upper-most left button is 1 and the lower-most right button is 6.

Some Yawman documentation refer to these as MF 1L (SP1), MF 1C (SP2), MF 1R (SP3), MF 2L (SP4), MF 2C (SP5), MF 2R (SP6)
